## [0.0.1] - 2023-08-30

### Added

- Ejs template engine to show the events that are in the database.

### Changed

- Instead of trying to read the database (which had an error when reading because of the type of data it was), I tried to insert the events into the database with code and it worked.

- Musical events.

- Put the styles in the ejs (<styles>).

### Fixed

- Attempt to read the database.

### Unreleased

- Add plays apart from musical events.
- Delete css files (maybe).
- Insert the events in the ejs
